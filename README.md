## Find 3 different information structures with different access technologies 

Find 3 different information structures with different access technologies (e.g. API, DB connection, file download and read locally). Write python functions to access each one and print out a sample of the information. In comments for each function, describe pros and cons of the access methodology. Upload code to Github and share URL, make sure any instructions needed to run are available in comments, preferably downloading and running the python is as simple as possible. 

Examples of different information structures:

JSON
XML
Text
HTML
CSV
PDF
Examples of different access technologies:

API connection over HTTP for structured data to Site A
API connection over HTTP for structured data to Site B
HTTP to download webpage
SQL database connection
Library to connect to remote storage like AWS S3 or Azure Blob storage
Manual file download and read/load in Python
You can use any programming language.
